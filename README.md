In the back-end realm, my expertise in Nest.js, Express.js, Java, Python, and diverse database languages like MongoDB, MySql, and PostgreSQL drives me to learn more and more. I have experience in Git for versioning control, and Figma, essential tools for modern web development. Additionally, i have knowledge in SEO, which allows me to create websites and applications that are easily found by users in search engines.
