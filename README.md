- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, my name is Ana Gabriela, i'm 22 years old and i'm a web developer, a technical nurse and i'm graduating in Biological Sciences.

I have knowledge of the technologies: Advanced HTML; Advanced in CSS; Advanced in React; Average in JavaScript; Average in Python; Median in Node; Average in Scrum; Basic in Postgres; Basics in Docker; Basic in TypeScript.

Bootcamp:
- [Maratona Explorer - Rocketseat]: With the advice of Professor Mayk, i was able to learn basic programming concepts, which i didn't have contact with before because i'm in career transition, learning programming by myself.
- [CursoemVideo]: With the help of Professor Guanabara i entered the world of programming. I had my first Python classes where i could apply the knowledge using the URI. Then, i took classes in HTML5, CSS3 and Javascript where i could do projects applying this knowledge; 
- [GoStack - Rocketseat]: In GoStack 2020 i was able to cover my knowledge of languages and have my first contact with the back-end with Node.js and front-end with ReactJS, in addition, i was also able to learn the main concepts and applications of Typescript. In this class, it was possible to have basic notions of React Native on the front-end and contact with Docker that helped to control the application's external services and PostgreSQL as a database.
- [Ignite Lab - Rocketseat]: I was able to learn even more about React using new technologies that i still didn't have contact with, such as tailwind, graphcms and Apollo Client. With the help of Professor Diego, we made an application together putting these technologies into practice.
