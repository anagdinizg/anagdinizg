# Ana's Developer Portfolio

## Introduction

Welcome to my GitHub repository! My name is Ana, a 25-year-old Brazilian currently pursuing a degree in Information Systems. I have a passion for programming, which started as a self-taught journey. After discovering my affinity for the field, I decided to pursue a formal education in Information Systems to deepen my knowledge and skills.

## Background

Throughout my academic and professional journey, I've had the opportunity to explore various aspects of software development. I've interned at two different organizations, one focusing on frontend development and the other on full-stack development. These experiences provided me with invaluable hands-on experience and insight into the industry.

## Current Role

Currently, I am employed as a Frontend Developer at a Japanese software house. In this role, I engage in daily communication with my multinational team, where English serves as our primary language. Our projects predominantly utilize React and Vue, allowing me to further strengthen my expertise in these technologies.
