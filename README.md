In GoStack 2020 i was able to cover my knowledge of languages and have my first contact with the back-end with Node.js and front-end with ReactJS, in addition, i was also able to learn the main concepts and applications of Typescript. In this class, it was possible to have basic notions of React Native on the front-end and contact with Docker that helped to control the application's external services and PostgreSQL as a database.
